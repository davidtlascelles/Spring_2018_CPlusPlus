This was the 2nd project of my C++ course at Irvine Valley College, 2/7/2018
Exam 2 Program Assignment:
 Use function templates to perform basic array manipulation on arrays of different data types. 
 The first function template should allow the user to enter the array data from the keyboard.
 The second function template should print the second largest value for an array without sorting. You may assume that each array contains distict data, that is no duplicates.
 The third function template should sort the array data in ascending order.
 The fourth function template should save the array data to a text file.
 The fifth function template should retrieve the array data from the text file.
 Output should include the second largest value for each array along with all three arrays being printed out in ascending order twice, once before the text file is saved and once after the array is retrieved from the text file.
 Each array should be saved to a separate text file. You will also need to show all three text files which you can do from any text editor when submitting the program.
