This was the first assignment from my C++ course at Irvine Valley College, 1/31/2018.
I was unable to find the origional assignment information, but the assignment involved creating a program to accept input about students and calculate information about a student's grade, as well as the class's grade. 

Includes basic I/O, text file handling, basic structures, and demonstrating an understanting of scoping of data in structures
