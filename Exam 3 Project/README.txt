 Exam 3 Program Assignment:
 Create a class for working with fractions. Only 2 private data members are needed: The int numerator of the fraction, and the positive int denominator of the fraction. For example, the fraction 3/7 will have the two private data member values of 3 and 7. The following methods should be in your class:
 
 a. A default constructor that should use default arguments in case no initializers
 are included in the main. The fraction needs to be stored in reduced form.
 Make sure the denominator is not set to 0 or a negative value.
 
 b. Add two fractions and store the difference in reduced form.
 
 c. Subtract two fractions and store the difference in reduced form.
 
 d. Multiply two fractions and store the product in reduced form.
 
 e. Divide two fractions and store the quotient in reduced form
 
 f. Print a fraction.
 
 g. Change a fraction to its reciprocal. For example, the reciprocal of the fraction 5/8 is 8/5.
 
 Your main should instantiate two fractions and call each of the class methods. The two fractions should be printed along with the sum, difference, product, quotient, and after being changed to its reciprocal. (Please do not overload the operators for this program.)
